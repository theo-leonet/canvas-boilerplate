# 🧰 Canvasbp

Canvasbp is a tiny library that allows HTML5 canvas developers to start their 2d canvas projects faster.

This project includes the code you always rewrite at the start of your projects and a few more tools.

I'll try my best to document this project properly as I want it to be easily picked up.

## 🎉 Getting started

If you don't want to use npm, you can always fork then clone this repository.
